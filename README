An unbeatable game of tic-tac-toe!

Setup:
  This can be played by cloning this repository and installing dependencies with `bundle install`. Tests can be run via the `rake test` command.
The game itself can be run with `bin/game'.

Notes:
  This game uses the minimax algorithm for its unbeatable computer player. I learned about this algorithm from http://www.neverstopbuilding.com/minimax. I also drew test cases from this article as well as a few ways to simplify the minimax algorithm.
