An unbeatable game of tic-tac-toe!

Setup:
  This can be played by cloning this repository and installing dependencies with `bundle install`. Tests can be run via the `rake test` command.
The game itself can be run with `bin/game'.

Notes:
  This game uses the minimax algorithm for its unbeatable computer player. I learned about this algorithm from http://www.neverstopbuilding.com/minimax. I also drew test cases based on examples from this article as well as a few ways to simplify the minimax algorithm.

Things I would like to improve:
I have not dealt with error handling much in the past and I feel that I am currently handling error cases in a somewhat inelegant way.
The design of the tic_tac_toe.rb file also feels clumsy and bloated.
