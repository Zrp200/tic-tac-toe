Features:
  GamePlay script
    - begins game -- will initialize the board and computer player(will set each player's character, 'x' or 'o')
    - will have an infinite loop that will check for game end condition.

  GameState object
      - win conditions etc will probably become the responsibility of this class.

  ComputerPlayer
    - will need to take in a game_state for that it can check if a win condition has been met.
    - need to refactor existing mini_max function to be less obfuscated -- refactor into smaller functions etc
